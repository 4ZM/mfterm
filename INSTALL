Installation of mfterm

If you got the sources from git, run "./autogen.sh" to have the auto
tools generate some files requried for the build. If you got the
source from a source code distribution, then you do not have to
perform this step.

To build and install mfterm issue the commands:

$ ./autogen.sh      # If using the sources from the git repo
$ ./configure       # Possibly with some options, use --help
$ make
$ make install      # Possibly using sudo 

Dependencies for building mfterm are: libnfc (1.6), libreadline,
libcrypto, OpenSSL, bison, flex.
