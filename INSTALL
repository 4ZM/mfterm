Installation of mfterm

If you got the sources from git, run "./autogen.sh" to have the auto
tools generate some files requried for the build. If you got the
source from a source code distribution, then you do not have to
perform this step.

To build and install mfterm issue the commands:

$ ./autogen.sh      # If using the sources from the git repo
$ ./configure       # Possibly with some options, use --help
$ make
$ make install      # Possibly using sudo 

Dependencies for building mfterm are: libnfc (1.7.0), libreadline,
libcrypto, OpenSSL, bison, flex.

Trouble shooting:

If you get error messages when trying to read a tag. Verify that
libnfc is installed and configured correctly with the 'nfc-list'
utility program (supplied with libnfc). It should not give you any
error messages and if you place a tag on your reader, it should be
detected.

When building, if you get the error message: 
"error: implicit declaration of function ‘rpl_malloc’"

Try this: after running the autogen, but before running the configure,
set the shell variable:

$ export ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes

then run configure, make, make install again.
